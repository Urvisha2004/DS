Problem / Situation
FreshMart Supermarket used outdated manual and semi-digital systems such as Excel, Tally, and manual stock registers.
These systems were not integrated, creating departmental silos and inefficiencies.
This resulted in:
•	Frequent stock-outs and overstocking
•	Lack of real-time visibility of inventory
•	Inaccurate stock valuation
•	Slow billing during peak hours
•	Errors in purchase planning
•	No proper tracking of expiry or near-expiry items
•	High wastage for fruits and vegetables
•	Difficulty managing multiple store branches
•	Manual reporting consuming 3–4 hours daily
The management decided to adopt a modern Retail ERP system to unify and digitize all operations.
